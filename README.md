# VBA_challenge
A demonstration for using VBA to perform data analysis on Stock Markwt data

Stock market data for the years 2014 to 2016 was used. This analysis yelds the total volume for the year, the annual change in the stocks' prices, and the percentage change between the opening price for the year and the closing price. 
Additionally, the analysis yoelds the notable performers among the lited stocks. This analysis can be applied to most repeated measures data nd for pther financial tasks.

The first noteable feature of the dataset used was its incredible size. While the acerage layperson will probably be fine with using Vanilla Excel without VBA, 700,000 rows would be a tedious task to manually program on Excel. Basic allows for the automation of Excel functions so that they itterate through entire columns in large datasets, as with this mini-project. In addition, Basic can also be used to summarize large datasets as was also demonstrated in this acivity. Basic also demonstrates the most fundamental application of data functions that would be standard in many languages used in Data Science.
